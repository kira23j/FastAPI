# Flask Projects

This Flask project serves as a template for building backend APIs with Flask. The main application logic is in `app.py` and includes sample API routes.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `specific flask_project` directory.

2. Set up a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On Unix or MacOS:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Run the Flask development server:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

6. Access the API at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

Feel free to explore and modify the project for your own backend development needs.
